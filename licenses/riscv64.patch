-		       The Artistic License 2.0
-
-	    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
-
-     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-Preamble
-
-This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
-Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
-The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
-control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
-Package available as open source and free software.
-
-You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
-license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
-terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
-make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
-a different licensing arrangement. 
-
-Definitions
-
-    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
-    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
-
-    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
-    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
-    procedures.
-
-    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
-    distribute, or modify the Package.
-
-    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
-    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
-    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
-    Version, or a Modified Version.
-
-    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
-    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
-    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
-
-    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
-    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
-    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
-
-    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
-    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
-    by the Copyright Holder.
-
-    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
-    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
-    Holder. 
-
-    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
-    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
-    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
-
-    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
-    configuration files for the Package.
-
-    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
-    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
-    translation of the Source form.
-
-
-Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
-
-(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
-Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
-you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
-
-
-Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
-
-(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
-Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
-either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
-all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
-your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
-Compiled form of the Package.
-
-(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
-modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
-Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
-will be subject to the Original License.
-
-
-Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source 
-
-(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
-or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
-Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
-from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
-any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
-you do at least ONE of the following:
-
-    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
-    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
-    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
-    Version.
-
-    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
-    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
-    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
-    from the name of the Standard Version.
-
-    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
-    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
-    under
-		
-	(i)  the Original License or
-
-	(ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
-	modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
-	licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
-	received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
-	Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
-	available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
-	Fees are allowed.
-
-
-Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version 
-or Modified Versions without the Source
-
-(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
-the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
-get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
-valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
-time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
-must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
-If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
-days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
-you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
-
-(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
-the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
-the Source of the Modified Version.
-
-
-Aggregating or Linking the Package 
-
-(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
-Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
-aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
-Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
-components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
-apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
-as included in the aggregation.
-
-(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
-other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
-build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
-include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
-provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
-
-
-Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version 
-
-(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
-merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
-the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
-considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
-terms of this license.
-
-
-General Provisions
-
-(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
-Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
-modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
-use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
-license.
-
-(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
-Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
-to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
-this license.
-
-(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
-service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
-
-(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
-free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
-sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
-patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
-infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
-that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
-infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
-date that such litigation is filed.
-
-(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
-THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
-IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
-WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
-NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
-LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
-BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
-DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
-ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

-1. Definitions
-
-   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

-   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

-

-
-   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
-   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
-   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

-   5.
-
-      For the avoidance of doubt:

-         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
-         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
-
-The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
-
-4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
-
-   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
-   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
-   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
-
-5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
-
-UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. Termination
-
-   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
-   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
-
-8. Miscellaneous
-
-   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
-   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
-   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
-   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
-   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

-
-4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

-   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.

For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

-         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
-   5. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
-
-5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
-
-UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. Termination
-
-   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
-   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
-
-8. Miscellaneous
-
-   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
-   2. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-   3. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
-   4. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
-   5. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

-
-3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

-   2. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.
-   3.
-
-      For the avoidance of doubt:
-         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.

-
-4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
-
-   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
-   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
-   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
-
-5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
-
-UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. Termination
-
-   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
-   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
-
-8. Miscellaneous
-
-   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
-   2. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-   3. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
-   4. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
-   5. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

-
-        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are

-            Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
-            Modifications made by that Contributor.
-
-3. Distribution Obligations.
-
-    3.1. Availability of Source Code.
-
-    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
-    available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
-    Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
-    the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
-    License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
-    Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must
-    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
-    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
-    form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
-    used for software exchange.
-
-    3.2. Modifications.
-
-    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
-    governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
-    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
-    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
-    License.
-
-    3.3. Required Notices.
-
-    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
-    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
-    not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
-    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
-    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
-    the Initial Developer.
-
-    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
-
-    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
-    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
-    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
-    choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
-    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
-    Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
-    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
-    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
-    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
-    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
-    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
-    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
-    liability terms You offer.
-
-    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
-
-    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
-    under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
-    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
-    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
-    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
-    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
-    the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
-    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
-    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
-    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
-    Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
-    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
-    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
-    such terms You offer.
-
-    3.6. Larger Works.
-
-    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
-    other code not governed by the terms of this License and
-    distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
-    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
-    for the Covered Software.
-
-4. Versions of the License.
-
-    4.1. New Versions.
-
-    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
-    publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
-    time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
-    Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
-    steward has the right to modify this License.
-
-    4.2. Effect of New Versions.
-
-    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
-    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
-    License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
-    If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
-    Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
-    available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
-    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
-    of the version of the License under which You originally received
-    the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
-    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
-    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
-    the license steward.
-
-    4.3. Modified Versions.
-
-    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
-    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
-    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
-    and remove any references to the name of the license steward
-    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
-    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
-    differ from this License.
-

-    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
-    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
-    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
-    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
-    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
-    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
-    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
-    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
-    DISCLAIMER.
-
-6. TERMINATION.
-
-    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
-    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
-    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
-    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
-    the termination of this License shall survive.
-
-    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
-    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
-    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
-    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
-    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
-    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
-    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
-    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
-    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
-    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
-    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
-    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
-    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
-    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
-    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
-    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
-
-    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
-    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
-    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
-    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
-
-7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
-
-    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
-    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
-    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
-    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
-    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
-    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
-    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
-    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
-    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
-    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
-    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
-    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
-    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
-    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
-    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
-    APPLY TO YOU.
-
-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
-
-    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
-    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
-    computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
-    C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
-    documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
-    (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
-    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
-    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
-    rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
-    lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
-    provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
-    under this License.
-
-9. MISCELLANEOUS.
-
-    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
-    matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
-    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
-    necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
-    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
-    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
-    if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
-    conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
-    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
-    in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
-    within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
-    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
-    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
-    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
-    of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
-    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
-    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
-    that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
-    States export administration regulations (and the export control
-    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
-    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
-
-10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
-
-    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
-    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
-    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
-    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
-    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing
-    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
-    of liability.

-Common Public License Version 1.0
-
-THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
-LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
-CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-1. DEFINITIONS
-
-"Contribution" means:
-
-    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
-    distributed under this Agreement, and
-
-    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-    i) changes to the Program, and
-
-    ii) additions to the Program;
-
-    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
-    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-    Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-    acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-    the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
-    not derivative works of the Program.
-
-"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-combined with the Program.
-
-"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
-Agreement.
-
-"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
-including all Contributors.
-
-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-    distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
-    such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-
-    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
-    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
-    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
-    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
-    Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
-    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-    covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
-    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
-    licensed hereunder.
-
-    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
-    to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-    property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
-    to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-    rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-    responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-    For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
-    license before distributing the Program.
-
-    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
-    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
-    set forth in this Agreement.
-
-3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
-its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-
-    b) its license agreement:
-
-    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-    conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
-    and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
-    and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-    damages, such as lost profits;
-
-    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
-    by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-
-    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
-    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
-    or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
-
-When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-
-    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
-
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
-the Program.
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
-if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
-the originator of the Contribution.
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
-to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
-any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
-participate in any such claim at its own expense.
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-5. NO WARRANTY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
-and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
-of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
-costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
-data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
-WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. GENERAL
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
-remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
-parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
-necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
-to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
-a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
-Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
-is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
-entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
-hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
-granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
-filed.
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
-and survive.
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to

-Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-
-THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-1. DEFINITIONS
-
-"Contribution" means:
-
-a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-i) changes to the Program, and
-
-ii) additions to the Program;
-
-where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
-
-"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-
-"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-
-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-
-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
-
-3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-
-b) its license agreement:
-
-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
-
-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-
-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
-
-When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-
-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
-
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-5. NO WARRANTY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. GENERAL
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
-
-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

-NAME
-    perlartistic - the Perl Artistic License
-
-SYNOPSIS
-     You can refer to this document in Pod via "L<perlartistic>"
-     Or you can see this document by entering "perldoc perlartistic"
-
-DESCRIPTION
-    This is "The Artistic License". It's here so that modules, programs,
-    etc., that want to declare this as their distribution license, can link
-    to it.
-
-    It is also one of the two licenses Perl allows itself to be
-    redistributed and/or modified; for the other one, the GNU General Public
-    License, see the perlgpl.
-
-The "Artistic License"
-  Preamble
-    The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
-    Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
-    semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
-    giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
-    Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
-    reasonable modifications.
-
-  Definitions
-    "Package"
-        refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
-        Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
-        textual modification.
-
-    "Standard Version"
-        refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been
-        modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
-        specified below.
-
-    "Copyright Holder"
-        is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
-
-    "You"
-        is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
-        Package.
-
-    "Reasonable copying fee"
-        is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
-        charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
-        required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
-        computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
-
-    "Freely Available"
-        means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may
-        be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
-        of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
-        received it.
-
-  Conditions
-    1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
-        Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
-        you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
-        disclaimers.
-
-    2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
-        derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A
-        Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
-        Standard Version.
-
-    3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
-        provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
-        stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
-        at least ONE of the following:
-
-        a)  place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
-            them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
-            Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on
-            a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the
-            Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
-            Version of the Package.
-
-        b)  use the modified Package only within your corporation or
-            organization.
-
-        c)  rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
-            with standard executables, which must also be provided, and
-            provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
-            that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
-
-        d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
-
-    4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
-        executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
-
-        a)  distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
-            files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
-            equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
-
-        b)  accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
-            the Package with your modifications.
-
-        c)  give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
-            document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
-            together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
-
-        d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
-
-    5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
-        Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
-        Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
-        you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
-        commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
-        software distribution provided that you do not advertise this
-        Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's
-        interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall
-        be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
-        complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
-
-    6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
-        output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
-        under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
-        them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
-        Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
-        Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing
-        a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
-        neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
-        fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
-        do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of
-        this Package.
-
-    7.  C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
-        languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
-        emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
-        Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
-        equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
-        not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
-        regression tests for the language.
-
-    8.  Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
-        permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that
-        is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces
-        visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use
-        shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
-
-    9.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
-        promote products derived from this software without specific prior
-        written permission.
-
-    10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
-        WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-        MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
-
-    The End

-This version:
-http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231
-
-This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
-31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
-this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
-W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references
-to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the
-ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the
-previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software
-Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
-under the Open Source Definition.
